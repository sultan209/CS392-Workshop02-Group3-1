# Food Prediction.
### Description:
Machine-learning approach for automated and systematic prediction of nutrient content available in food.
### Installation instructions:
```js
git clone https://github.com/AhmedAl-Sardi/CS392-Workshop02-Group3.git
cd CS392-Workshop02-Group3
git submodule update --init
docker-compose up 
```
### Operating instructions:
Write any kind of food ingredients on the text field and press submit then the result will appear on a text area. For example, If we write beef, tomato, and bread it will return a burger. For clearing the text there is a button that will clear all the fields and you will be ready to write again. While the text area is going to dynamically change.
note: You can access the website in port number 4200.
### Project structure:
In this project, we have a frontend and a backend. The frontend has a repository that is used in this repository as a submodel.
